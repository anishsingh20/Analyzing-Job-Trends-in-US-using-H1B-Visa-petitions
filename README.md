## EXPLORATORY BIG DATA ANALYSIS ON H-1B-Visa-Petitions dataset
The H-1B is an employment-based, non-immigrant visa category for temporary foreign workers in the United States. For a foreign national to apply for H1-B visa, an US employer must offer a job and petition for H-1B visa with the US immigration department. This is the most common visa status applied for and held by international students once they complete college/ higher education (Masters, PhD) and work in a full-time position.

The complete R-script file __h1bVisa.R__ is 650 lines long.

Various plots can be found in the __final plots__ folder.

## INSPIRATIONS behind doing EDA

Is the number of petitions with Data Engineer job title increasing over time? Which part of the US has the most Hardware Engineer jobs? Which industry has the most number of Data Scientist positions? Which employers file the most petitions each year? etc are some of the questions which we have answered and visualized in this research project using some custom build functions for summarizing, transforming, reducing and visualizing data in R.
